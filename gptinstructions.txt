You are a highly skilled Python developer and software architect with extensive experience in FastAPI, NiceGUI, and MySQL. I am working on a full-stack Gym Management project with:

Frontend: NiceGUI (Python-based UI)

Backend: FastAPI

Database: MySQL

Authentication: Auth0 with tokens stored in localStorage

Users & Roles:
Gym Member: view working hours, create/select training plans, view/book classes, weekly training preferences, live training page (exercise details, history, adjustments)

Trainer: view working hours, weekly training schedule, assigned trainees and their plans

Manager: view working hours, weekly schedule, live view of training halls with assigned trainers and trainees

Key Features Implemented:
✅ Homepage
✅ Working hours page
✅ Training plans page
✅ My trainings page (partial)
✅ Classes page
✅ My bookings page (classes only)
✅ First-time login full_details page
✅ Profile page

Key Features NOT Yet Implemented:
⏳ Training scheduling system (weekly schedule based on member preferences, trainer and hall availability)
⏳ Live training page (exercise details, plan adjustments)
⏳ Manager’s live dashboard

Table Schemas:
backend/database/saved_queries/tables_queries.py — current table definitions

backend/database/saved_queries/new_tables_queries.py — updated schemas (not applied yet)

I also have a userstable.csv with:

A manager row: manager_id=1, user_id=1, department="General", hire_date="2025-01-01"

A member row

Next Steps:
I want you to:
1️⃣ Review the entire project structure (all files and code)
2️⃣ Understand the logic and architecture
3️⃣ Review the database schemas and sample data
4️⃣ Get fully ready to help me with detailed tasks — like generating migration scripts, integrating the scheduling system, and implementing missing features.

Please ask me for any file or snippet you’d like to review (e.g., tables_queries.py, new_tables_queries.py, or any other code file). Let me know if you’d like me to paste or upload these files.










Now that you’ve reviewed the project and are ready for tasks, here’s the first task:

📌 Task:

Review all table definitions in tables_queries.py (current) and new_tables_queries.py (updated).

Identify all differences between the old and new schemas (added/removed/modified columns, constraints, data types, indexes).

Generate a single consolidated MySQL script containing CREATE TABLE statements for all necessary tables, ensuring the script fits the current project’s requirements.

For each table, specify:

Whether it changed compared to the original.

Exactly what changed (column additions, removals, renamed columns, constraint changes, etc.).

Consider the userstable.csv sample data:

Ensure that the new schema can accommodate the sample manager row (manager_id=1, user_id=1, department="General", hire_date="2025-01-01") and member row.

If you need to see the contents of any file, just ask me to provide it.
